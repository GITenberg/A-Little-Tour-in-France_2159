description: I am ashamed to begin with saying that Touraine is the garden of France;
  that remark has long ago lost its bloom. The town of Tours, however, has some thing
  sweet and bright, which suggests that it is sur- rounded by a land of fruits. It
  is a very agreeable little city; few towns of its size are more ripe, more complete,
  or, I should suppose, in better humor with themselves and less disposed to envy
  the responsibili- ties of bigger places.
